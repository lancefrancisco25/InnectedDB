Welcome!<br>ðŸ––
*Why write a whole paragraph if then I will get a TL;DR afterwards?*

**TS;DR**<br> A list of resources and people to contact for projects and problems in a specific field. Like asking on a forum, but directly to the person who will answer you.

# Building Websites/Web applications ðŸ’»
Here are listed people who can help or contribute actively in the creation of websites or web applications.
If you have questions or issues to solve about something even slightly related, asking them will lead you to solve the problem.
